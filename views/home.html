            <p class="brendan">Brendan Eich is an American computer programmer and
                technology executive. He created the JavaScript
                programming language and co-founded the Mozilla project,
                the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.
                He served as the Mozilla Corporation's chief technical
                officer before he was appointed chief executive officer,
                but resigned shortly after his appointment due to
                controversy over his opposition to same-sex marriage.
                He subsequently became the CEO of Brave Software.</p>
